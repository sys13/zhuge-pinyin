Learn Mandarin tones by testing your knowledge of Chinese characters


Type or paste in a sentence of Chinese characters. Then, the progarm uses the Stanford Chinese word segmenter to turn the individual characters into words. It then looks the words up in the CC-CEDICT Chinese-English dictionary. Type in the Mandarin tones (1-4 on your keyboard) and the program will let you know if you got it right or wrong.
